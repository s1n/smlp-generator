=head1 SYNOPSIS

Statistical Machine Language Generator

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this project is to generate machine language code based on the
collected corpus. Using various statistical methods and a context free grammar,
this project aims to generate machine language that will hopefully create some
rather interesting results. The goal is to create a website automatically that
is indistiguishable from the rest of the garbage on the internet.
