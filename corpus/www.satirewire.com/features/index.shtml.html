<font size="2" face="arial,helvetica" color="#000000">New York, N.Y. &#8212; Statistically, David Bates had all the earmarks of a potential criminal: he was well-groomed, between the ages of 35 and 55, drove a luxury car, wore a suit, smiled at odd times, and said very little of substance. He was, in short, a likely corporate executive, and to police, that was reason enough.

        in bright yellow slickers and waterproof hats, turned up at the brim, 



        of the Sou'wester Alliance. They are Afghanistan's forgotten warriors.
