<H3>Are these stories true?</H3>

</B><U><I>Yes!</I></U><I> </I>Darwin Awards and Honorable Mentions are
known or suspected to be true. Look for the word &quot;Confirmed&quot;
under the title. Media references are always cited below the story. Some
are suspected to be true because they sound plausible but the source is
unverified. Please send legitimate <A href="http://www.darwinawards.com/misc/contact.html">confirmations</A>
to&nbsp;Darwin.<BR>

<U><I>No!</I></U><I> </I>Urban&nbsp;Legends are definitely not true. They're fake. Bogus. That's why they're called legends! Personal&nbsp;Accounts are true  according to the author, but  they have not been verified.&nbsp;If the author has included a reference, it is cited at the end of the article.<BR>
&nbsp;

<A name="huh"></A>

<P><I>"Confirmed by Darwin" </I> means the story is true.  In the old days,
this meant it was submitted by multiple people, from several reputable
media sources such as news, television, radio magazine.  The determination
was partly intuitive; successive versions as the investigation progressed,
no grammar errors, a subtle implausibility alert, an aura of truth, and so
forth.  But nowadays, most stories are confirmed immediately by checking
the online sources.  But then, as now, eyewitnesses do add weight,
particularly multiple witnesses.

<P>In short, <B>they&nbsp;are&nbsp;true,</B> to the best of my knowledge!
Emails saying &nbsp;&quot;ain't&nbsp;true&quot; are bootless, unless you
have corroboration, like the <A href="http://www.darwinawards.com/legends/legends1998-11.html">NMSR
Science&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Reason Club</A> taking credit for a hoax.</P>

<H3>What about the peculiar LOGO?</H3>

I made it up, from a funky font, with colors and painstakingly positioned
letters.  Previous logos were my hand-drawn aniimations.  (Later I eschewed
all animation.)  Seven years later, Book 1 comes along, and I was so
excited.  Dutton created cover art for the book.  At last, a professional
logo!  When the cover arrived... imagine my horror.  Dutton used *my* my
logo <blush> So.  I am not enamoured of the logo.  <A
href="http://www.darwinawards.com/misc/link.html">Logo competitions</A> were held over the years, to
no avail.

<H3><I>What is it supposed to activate inside the reader?</I></H3>

Under the category of strange questions fans ask:<BR>
<B>Dear Markus:</B> For me, it's, "Wow, there but for the Grace of God go
I, Wendy," and I recall sub-catastrophic events in my past, and am thankful
to still be here!  Taking life for granted is a trap.  Appreciating life
and its short, sweet beauty... that's what activates inside me.  Reports
are also, "Wow I felt stupid, but compared to them I'm a genius!"  And also
a sense of justice, poetic justice, for example criminals caught in the
perpetration of crime.  A sense of karma. "What did you expect, you did
evil, then weren't consequences?"

<H3><I>What about the Darwin Awards Movie?</I></H3>

<P><I>"Did you take part in the making?"</I><BR>

<B>Dear Markus:</B> My project with Finn Taylor, who writes and directs a
supremely funny romp into the light side of the Darwin Awards.  A romantic
comedy, pitting Winona and Fiennes against a quirky entourage, and imminent
doom!  I watched some filming, read the script <A
href="email.html">(request copy of script)</A>, watched the director
cuts 3x, and loved it.  It will be entertaining to discuss the <A
href="../rules/index.html">Rules questions</A> that follow its general release.

<H3>Why did you name it the Darwin Awards?</H3>

<I>If God made us, why did he make us so stupid?</I>

<P><B>Dear Piet, </B> "Intelligent Design" is not a Christian belief.  It
does not eqate with knowing God is our Creator.  It's bullheaded stupidity
alone.  Designed to draw attention.  Please re-analyze your decision.  God
is our Creator?  Personal decision.  Intelligent Design?  That's plain
dumb.  Bless,&nbsp;Wendy</P>

<P>Piet is an "old fan [and] also a Christian who believes in Intelligent
Design as Christians do, that God is our Creator.  I can't help but wonder
if you share Christian belief in Intelligent design?" Oct.2006

<H2></A>Who is Wendy Northcutt?</H2>

<P>Who is John Galt?  Darwin wishes to be described as an internationally
renowned raconteur, a svelte brunette who spins eloquent yarns from
tragedy.  That doesn't make it so, but a girl can dream!  My audiences are
generally rolling in the aisles with laughter, so come and see for
yourself.  Or ask your college's events coordinators to invite me.  <A
href="http://www.phdcomics.com/speaking.htm">Here's how!</A></P>

<A name="censorship"></A>

</TD>
</TR>
<TR background="/i/bgmain.jpg">
<TD>

<H3>Censorship! What's the deal?</H3>

<P>It doesn't happen. Here are two examples: The JFK Jr. plane crash
was hashed out in the Philosophy Forum and members in good standing agreed
that it just wasn't novel and stupid enough to qualify. Newcomers wanted
JFK Jr. nominated because of his public image and the percieved magnitude
of his stupidity (grossly exaggerated.)  The jumping death of wrestler Owen
Hart also disqualified based on its merits, rather than on the heated WWF
outcry. He trusted event coordinators to provide a safe working
environment.</P>

<P>Censorship almost happened with the Texas Bonfire tragedy in
1999. Mutilation threats, tear-stained pictures of deceased students, anger
and woe poured into my mailbox.  One particularly vivid writer described
using a rusty spoon to scoop out my testicles. Luckily for me I&nbsp;don't
have testicles! Ten thousand angry and pleading emails helped convince me
to eliminate the event from consideration quickly. But it was the right
decision, and Aggie pressure just speeded up the process. The students who
were killed had every reason to think the construction was secure, and were
innocent bystanders to the tragedy.</P>
<P><A
href="http://www.darwinawards.com/rules/main.html">Read&nbsp;the&nbsp;Rules</A>.before you
decide it was censorship. <BR>Bribery, however, is encouraged
<B>&lt;-:</B>.<BR>
<I>(So far, to no avail.)</I></P>
<P>Ironically, emails that plead with me to remove a story often mention the humor of other Awards, and claim to be against censorship. Is it only funny if it happens to someone else? I don't think so. I'll feature my own mother if she pulls a Darwin. How about you?</P>

<H3>I sent you email.  When will I hear back?</H3>  

<P><B>If it's a question of privacy, </B> I try to respond right away.
With 2000 emails a week, your compliments, criticisms, and stories take
awhile to read. If a story is rejected, you'll usually know in a week or
two. If&nbsp;I&nbsp;like your story, it will take longer, but I will
contact you when I accept it and right before I publish it. </P>

<H3>Why are Urban Legends here? Legends aren't true!</H3>  

<P><B>They're&nbsp;funny! They're cautionary tales </B> of evolution in
action.  Urban Legends include inspirational narratives of legendary Darwin
Awards contenders. They portray heroes to hold up as powerful figures of
martyrdom for the good of the species. Many people write to ask for
specific Urban Legends, and these pages includes some of the most popular
(though fictitious) Darwin Awards.  That's why they're here.</P>

<P><B>Where can I buy the Darwin Awards Book?</B></P>
<P>Thanks for the support! The book is coming out in November 2000 in English! Spring 2001 in German! It  contains  all the stories on the website (except  a few duds) and then some. I expain the history of the Darwin Awards, and explore  eleven philosophical discussions. Can a clone win a Darwin? What if you're reincarnated? Which came&nbsp;first, the&nbsp;chicken&nbsp;or&nbsp;the&nbsp;egg? A&nbsp;website&nbsp;biography and some <A href="http://DarwinAwards.com/ikon/ubb/philosophy/000444.html">Darwin&nbsp;Haiku</A> round out the book. Ordering information will be along later this summer. Watch evolution happen right before your very eyes!</P>

<P><B><I>I  don't get it.  How is it humorous to joke and laugh&nbsp;at&nbsp;death?
</I></B>
<BR>
<I>"Comedy is simply a funny way of being serious." - Peter Ustinov</I><BR>
It's just one of the mysteries of life.  Black humor entertains some of us.
There is nothing wrong with either liking or not liking it.  My family and
friends, we actually laugh at the notion of finding each other featured on
these pages.  If you want to understand the humor, is to consider an evil
person who earns her ill-gotten rewards.  For example, the (legendary)
absentminded terrorist who sent a letter-bomb with insufficient postage.
The package was returned, and the terrorist opened the package, and blew
himself up!  It starts with poetic justice, and the sensibilities of Fate,
Nature herself deciding, "Should I stay or should I go?"</P>

<H3>Why can't I print the stories? (defunct)</H3>

Happily, you can now print the stories.  This question was from the
Frameset Years.  Javascript inadvertently prevented some pages from
printing.  An inconvenient but effective workaround: select all the text on
the page, (ctrl-a) to select all, (ctrl-c) to copy, (ctrl-v) to paste into
a text editor like Notepad.  Then print.</P>
